# algorithms-exercise-java
I'm a newbie.<br/>
This repository is just for fun and encourage me to continue to fill this respository and write more code about algorithms to train my logic and mathematical thinking like a supervisor.I'm not sure that anyone would find me and my little respository,but I'm still happy to create my first formal respository.I hope I can do something meaningful and I tried.<br/>
This respository is included some content about introdcution to algorithms and learning notes and some code.<br/>
By the way,my English is not good and it is not my first language,but I still try to write documents use it,so don't mind that if you found a lot of mistakes that I make,I'll try my best to avoid mistakes.<br/>
I know this is public,even no one cares what I create or write or upload,but this is public,I feel excited to expose my code first time.Yes,this is no big deal for lots of people,but for me,it is so mean to me.<br/>
